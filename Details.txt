In the competitive landscape of modern marketing, identifying meaningful and actionable patterns within customer data is crucial for developing effective targeting strategies and optimizing resource allocation. While traditional data mining techniques can uncover specific associations between customer attributes and behaviors, they often struggle to generalize these findings to broader populations and may be susceptible to biases present in the training data. This project addresses the challenge of deriving generalized association rules from a marketing dataset by employing a reference sample methodology and classification tree analysis. The primary objective is to identify robust and interpretable segments of the customer base characterized by high propensity for a specific target behavior (e.g., purchase, response to campaign), while mitigating the risk of overfitting to the training data. The results will be compared to established techniques, such as PRIM, to assess the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach in uncovering stable and generalizable marketing insights. Ultimately, this project aims to provide a framework for data-driven marketing decisions that are less prone to biases and more applicable to diverse customer segments, leading to improved campaign performance and increased return on investment.
